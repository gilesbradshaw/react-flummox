//render an element into a node using a resolver
creates a new Container with element as child and the resolver set
render(element, node, instance = new Resolver())

//soo.....
//container is created with state of the resolvers get container state
//get container state returns the current state from states for a containers id

//on mounting and changing props the containers.resolve() is called
//this sets state to the current getcontainerstate and if state is not fulfilled it calls resolver.resolve - when this calls back with final state it passes back a promise - sets the final state and resolves the promise when re rendered.

container.props.resolve contains promises to be resolved in order to produce state.
resolver.resolve...

//creates a list of promises and when each promise resolved
//sets state.values for it
//awaits all the promises and when all resolved fulfills state ie set state and call back
